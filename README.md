# Sightkick agent skill

Teach your AI agent to run SEO and AI-search visibility (AEO) for your
website through [Sightkick](https://sightkick.so) — the autopilot that
researches keywords, writes and publishes articles daily, tracks how ChatGPT,
Gemini and Google's AI answer your buyers' prompts, refreshes
underperformers, and proves results with Search Console data.

With this skill installed, your agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT,
Cursor) can:

- read your real Search Console + AI-visibility data and explain it —
  including the pages AI answers cite and the prompts you're losing
- write articles itself on your subscription — and grade them against
  Sightkick's five-pillar scorer until they're worth publishing
- work the Actions board: accept coverage cards (pages AI cites where your
  competitors are listed and you're not) and draft the pitches for you
- order work from the pipeline, steer the calendar and the writing dial,
  start tracking new prompts, publish (confirm-gated)
- run four named plays on request: **weekly pulse · gap fixer · coverage
  pitch · proof report**
- do it all attributably: every agent action shows up on your Actions board
  and activity feed as "Your agent"

## Install

The skill is the manual; the hands are Sightkick's remote MCP server.

1. Get a Sightkick account at [app.sightkick.so](https://app.sightkick.so)
   (agent access is included in every plan).
2. Connect the MCP — e.g. for Claude Code:

   ```sh
   claude mcp add --transport http sightkick https://app.sightkick.so/mcp
   ```

3. Install this skill so your agent knows how to use it well:

   ```sh
   npx skills add sightkick-so/sightkick-skill
   ```

The OAuth consent binds the connection to one workspace (one website).

## What's in here

- [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) — the agent-facing manual: tools by job, the
  writing/scoring loop, method rules, safety rules.
- [`workspace/`](workspace/) — your agent's persistent working memory for
  this site. Yours, git-ignorable, survives skill updates.
